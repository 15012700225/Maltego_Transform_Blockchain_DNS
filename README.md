# Maltego Transform Blockchain name system

This Maltego transform is used to explore the domain and 
IP connections stored in the (domain-)name systems for Namecoin and Emercoin.
The explored data includes both current and past relations, as the blockchain allows the viewing of historical values.

Example graph where the starting node was `pationare.bit`, from it one can find additional domains which has resolved towards the same IP addresses:
